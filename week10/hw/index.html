        <br><h2>Iterations</h2>
        The goal is to create an animation with drifting snowflakes (star shapes) and small circles in the background to show a holiday scene. I found this tutorial on a similar animation that I'd like the final result to look like. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0PG4MY39Eo">YouTube Tutorial.</a>

        <br><br><img src="Iteration 01.png" alt="">

        <br><br>In this iteration, you can see I have the gradient background that I'd like (blueish to white). But for some reason the circle particles are moving too fast and also the clusters are too dense.
        <br><br>

        <br><br><img src="Iteration 02.png" alt="">

        <br><br>In this iteration, I added in the snowflake shape but again, it's generating too fast and overlapping with the circle particles. There is also a gray color being produced which I do not want in the final product.
        <br><br>

        <br><br><img src="Iteration 03.png" alt="">

        <br><br>In this iteration, I tried moving the snow update into the same for loop drawing the circle particles but then the snowflakes starting covering up the circle particles. And by the end of the animation, you can only see gray and white snowflakes which was not the intended result.
        <br><br>

        <br><br><img src="Iteration 04.png" alt="">

        <br><br>For some reason after changing the background to black, the snowflakes and particles become more prominent and scatter in a more natural way. I'd like to keep this pace of movement and density of clusters of snowflakes but also go back to the blue to white gradient background. 
        <br><br>

        <br><br><img src="Iteration 05.png" alt="">

        <br><br>This is looking closer to how I want it. I have the snowflakes and snow particles moving in the density and speed I'd like. However, the background is still not showing up as the gradient colors I'd like. The snow particles have become the color I wanted the background to be. 
        <br><br>

        <br><br><img src="Iteration 06.png" alt="">

        <br><br>In this iteration, I have approximately what I'd like the final animation to look like with the snowflakes and snow particles as white and the background as a blue to white gradient. Finally, I'd like to iterate to make the snowflakes at the front move at a slower speed for a more smooth animation.

    <br><br> In the final animation, you can see a "blizzard" scene with different shaped snowflakes (circles and stars). The speed of the background particles are moving slower than the bigger snowflakes that are top of the particles.
