    <h1>Reading Week Homework - 10/10/23</h1>
    <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><i>“However, the fundamental problem with this approach is that static design tools like Illustrator and Sketch fail at prototyping digital systems.”</i></li>
    <br>It was interesting and kind of funny to me to read this quote because I remember at the start of college (2017), Sketch and XD were still the most widely used tools to create and prototype designs. Nowadays, the main tools are completely shifted to Figma, Prototopie and maybe other ones I’m not familiar with. It reminds me that technology is always changing and improving and definitely the importance of keeping up with the latest trends and softwares.
    <li><i>“Second, code enables designers to do things they couldn't do before. Variations of a design can be tested much faster during the prototyping phase, and randomization can be used to reveal designs that the designer would never have created with a pencil.”</i></li>
    <br>I still am unsure about my stance of designers having to “code”. I do think it’s useful to have a basic understanding of programs such as html/css/js especially if one is a web designer. However, the part that says “variations of design can be tested much faster” is somewhat untrue in my opinion. I’ve taken a couple of coding classes in undergrad and am familiar with html/css/js but it is not much faster for me to code something vs possibly just engaging in a conversation with engineering about what I envision for an interaction and even showing examples. 
    <li><i>“It is also important to note that this is not a book about web design. Although the examples can be embedded on any web page, the techniques can be applied to both digital and print work.”</i></li>
    <br>After reading this overview of Programming Design Systems, I am interested in reading the book and learning more practical applications of coding. I think the part that says “techniques can be applied to both digital and print work” is also interesting as print is viewed as a physical form of media so I’m curious how coding would come into play for physical solutions. 

    <h2>What do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>
    <li><i>“To design well, designers must be willing to use different tools for different prototyping tasks; and to team up with other people with complementary skills.”</i></li>
    <br>This is definitely a quote that resonated with me since I often find myself in my job having to prototype different interactions in separate prototypes or utilizing various ways to express an interaction. For example, annotating prototypes so that viewers even know how to use the prototype and then prototyping the interaction itself maybe in Figma. As well as walking through the prototype in a live demo. I also agree with how it is important to team with other people such as engineers to discuss whether an interaction is even technically possible or efficient in the timeline we are working with for a certain project.
    <li><i>“User testing with a foam-core model showed that the most important manipulations of a space planning task were sliding, lifting, and turning furniture objects.“</i></li>
    <br>It was interesting to read about different forms of prototypes that have been explored. Even though the designers for this project were using a physical model to get user feedback, they were actually exploring digital solutions. I hadn’t really thought much about how physical prototypes can translate to digital solutions and it will definitely be something I consider and think more about for future projects if given the opportunity to explore physical prototypes.
    <li><i>“They began to consider many different options including designing the computer to feel more like a soft shoulder bag.”</i></li>
    <br>I was a bit confused at this part since the designers seemed to infer different options just after knowing the pizza box wasn’t the right shape or size for their solution. I’m not sure how they settled on a “soft shoulder bag” but wonder if maybe the research and conclusions were summarized to focus more on the prototype process itself.
