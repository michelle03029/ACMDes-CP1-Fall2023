    <h1>Week 9: Pattern, Rhythm, Movement</h1>
    <br><h2>Ideation & Approach</h2>
    First off, I started by sketching out what I want to display for this homework assignment.
    <br>

    Another piece of inspiration is an animated swirling game logo from work that I wanted to try to replicate that feeling of flowing swirls/circular shapes. Almost like fog or clouds.

    As always, I like to start with a YouTube tutorial to learn. I thought this one seemed similar to something I sketched out.

    <h2>List of encountered problems:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Image not resizing to the canvas</li>
        <li>Browser loading slow because of animated particles</li>
        <li>Particles moving too slow</li>
        <li>Want image to be revealed at the end of the animation</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><b>Most interesting problem</b><br>
    The most interesting problem was parsing through the code and trying to fix the above problems listed. For example, seemed like the particles were moving too slow and this was solved by adjusting the density to be a lower number. Seems like the particles were moving slower due to more particles on the screen and having less space to move around. But when the density decreases, just like a person moving through a smaller crowd- the particles looked more sped up. 

    <br><br>This week's in class exercise and homework was interesting to me because it really shows that most images and patterns that we see all come down to simple shapes and lines that make up the overall visual. The most helpful part of the in-class exercise was that also we were shown how to load in an image which worked well with this assignment since that became the base of the pattern created.  

    <br><h2>Final Result</h2>
    Here is the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/michelle03029/sketches/l8EopMvNt">final prototype.</a> The prototype is best viewed in Chrome as other browsers are causing the prototype to load or even break the user's browser.
