        <h1>Complex Interactive System HW</h1>

        <br><h2>UML Diagram</h2>
        The system I am making a UML diagram for is a bee or wasp pollinating flowers. Bees and wasps are actually herbivores gathering food for their offspring. A bee's role in pollination is completely incidental. They're just trying to collect the most pollen, nectar, or floral oils possible. To plants, bees are useful tools in their quest to spread pollen and reproduce.</a>

        <br><h2>Flow Chart</h2>
        In the flow chart, I am mapping out the interactions between the bees and wasps with the flowers.</a>

        <br><h2>Final System</h2>

    <main>
    In the final system, you can see random bees and wasps being generated. Once the user interacts with a flower as the bee/wasp, the flowers change color to show that it has been pollinated. I was able to find an example of something I'd like in a p5js library. Here is the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/pan8915/sketches/BJAHU1W6">Sample Code.</a>
