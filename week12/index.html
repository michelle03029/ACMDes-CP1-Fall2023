        <br><h1>Find Your Interface HW</h1>

        <br><h2>Ideas</h2>
        Two ideas I have for my "interface" include opening your hand and having random food items generate. Or having AI recognize the foods in one's fridge.</a>

        <br><h2>First Prototype</h2>
        Based on what we learned in class, I was able to have the video display a "skeleton" only when a hand is displayed.</a>

        <br><h2>In Class Discussion - 12/5</h2>
        Based on bouncing ideas off with the professor, I decided to change directions for my prototype. I am thinking of making a game similar to Fruit Ninja where the user can use their hand to interact with fruit to score points. It will also have another feature which is similar to Bubble Launcher where the player has to get three of the same fruits stacked in a row to have it fall off the screen before the screen becomes too full.
    
        To help visualize the prototype, I created a flow chart to think about what features and interactions the game will have.</a>

        <br><h2>Adding in further interactions</h2>
        In class, the professor also helped walk me through how we might have random fruits appear in a good pacing via the code. I was able to add this in based on a particle example he showed. Particle example can be found  <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1304249"> here. </a> I was able to embed the fruits via creating a fruit class and loading in images found online of a watermelon. Then having the fruit randomly produce via an array.

        <br><br> Next, I needed to add in the interaction of having the fruit disappear off the screen when the user's hand interacts with it. I tried this code below but it still was not working as intended. It doesn't seem like the user interacting the fruit does anything, neither does the mouse. After talking it through with my professor, I realized that this touch function is for mobile devices and not for the handpose interaction.

        <br><h2>Finishing up the prototype</h2>
        The main thing I was missing in the code is defining the positioning of the pointer finger and when the positioning is around 10px away from the fruit, the fruit should disappear from the screen. And then also generating more fruit types in the array. I ended up adding in two more fruits of strawberries and pears apart from the watermelon.

        Lastly, I decided to turn off the camera as it was mirroring and flipping the hand pose which was confusing when interacting with the fruits. I also added in a circle to the tip of the pointer finger to make it easier for the user to see where they are pointing to.

        <br><h2>Final Interface</h2>
        Here is the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/michelle03029/sketches/K12HIpdh0">final prototype.</a> You can play the game by using your pointer finger to "slice" the fruit. When your pointer finger interacts with the fruit, the fruit disappears off screen.

        <br><br>For a final touch, I also wanted the score to display whenever a user successfully "slices" a fruit and it disappears off screen.
