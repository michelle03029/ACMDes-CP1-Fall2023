        <h1>Find Your Interface HW</h1>

        <br><h2>Ideas</h2>
        Two ideas I have for my "interface" include opening your hand and having random food items generate. Or having AI recognize the foods in one's fridge.</a>

        <br><h2>First Prototype</h2>
        Based on what we learned in class, I was able to have the video display a "skeleton" only when a hand is displayed.</a>

        <br><h2>In Class Discussion - 12/5</h2>
        Based on bouncing ideas off with the professor, I decided to change directions for my prototype. I am thinking of making a game similar to Fruit Ninja where the user can use their hand to interact with fruit to score points. It will also have another feature which is similar to Bubble Launcher where the player has to get three of the same fruits stacked in a row to have it fall off the screen before the screen becomes too full.
    
        To help visualize the prototype, I created a flow chart to think about what features and interactions the game will have.</a>

        <br><h2>Final Interface</h2>
        Here is the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/pan8915/sketches/BJAHU1W6">final prototype.</a>
