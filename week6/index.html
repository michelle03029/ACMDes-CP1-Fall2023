    <h1>Week 6: Product Interface</h1>
    <br><h2>Ideation & Approach</h2>
    First off, I started by sketching out what might be in product interface for my Gem Car dashboard.

    I am ideally aiming to build out these parts: steering wheel, the blinker controls, the car digital dashboard, and possibly some physical buttons/controls (depending on the direction of my project).
    
    <br>
    After sketching out my idea of what I need to build out, I started with the first large component in mind which was the steering wheel. I found a helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2U06kpqrGE">YouTube Tutorial</a> that went over how to create a basic steering wheel starting with the torus shape. It was pretty easy to follow but one main mistake that I made and might need to fix is how there is an empty hole in the middle of where the brand logo usually sits.

    Other than that, I think the steering wheel is mostly what I'd like to look like. One thing I also need to figure out is how to add in the Gem car logo to the center of the wheel as a 3d shape. I'd want the brandmark to protrude a bit like logos in other cars. My favorite part of the modelling process from the various objects I've made so far is definitely adding in materials and textures. To make the steering wheel look similar to the Tesla steering wheel since I like the materials Tesla uses, I turned down up the roughness after smoothing out the torus. I also would like my car and dashboard to look somewhat minimalistic so I chose a light blue, almost white accent color for the parts of the wheel that the driver holds. And the rest of the wheel is a black material.
